### pt a:

The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.

### pt b:

Same as above but instead of them next to each other, use the ones on the opposite side of the arrat

### notes
This is going to be much slower than when I used python. Python has a lot of very convenient short cuts particularly because of it's dynamic typing. 

Need to find some nice short cuts as I go along.
